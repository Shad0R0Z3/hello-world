My Annoucement
I am a mother of two and a veteran. My rate was an aviation structural mechanic and sheet metal fabricator. I did go to college for a few years for a major in Forensic Psychology and a minor in Advanced Psychology but I didn't finish my last semester of my bachelorâ€™s degree thus having no certifications nor degrees. Since both children are in their last few years of school I figured I would return as well; especially if the military is going to pay for my associates degree. Now, I'm on another journey in my career and hoping to peruse a career in Information Technology.
